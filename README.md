Image logs can provide critical information to reduce drilling risk, as they allow for early detection of structures such as faults or fractures. This kind of information can be critical during drilling operations, but the time required to manually interpret the data and the subjectivity of interpretations can undermine the timeliness of delivery of results. The proposed methodology is a supervised Deep Learning - based method built on U-Net architecture for segmentation of image logs acquired while drilling, i.e., automated detection of geological edges in borehole images. The proposed network has been trained on synthetic data and tested on field data. Curriculum learning involves a pre-training step on simple cases and a fine-tuning step on more complex ones, whereas standard learning is composed of one single step on a set of cases of random complexity.  The results of curriculum learning (CL-PickNet) show that the networkâ€™s predictions return more populated segmentation maps than those of the network trained with standard training (SL-PickNet) and can help the development of a fully automated system for the interpretation of image logs. On the resulting segmentation maps we then perform the non-linear regression for the correlation of features and observe the different results on the CL-PickNet and SL-PickNet predictions using FiNet05. The workflow is resumed in the figure.

- #  in the 01_MC_serverp05 folder you can find the following  files:
  -  01_train: file for FitNet05 training
  -  fig, animations folder containing figures of Montecarlo Dropout method results and animations of features correlation of Fitnet05 on CL and SL segmentation maps
  -  FitNet05 model: the saved model that produced the results in the paper.

- #  in the output folder you can find:
In thid folder you find the data to reproduce the results in the paper.
These are .npy files that can be loaded in a python file using numpy.

- LWD data interval: for confidentiality agreement, I can't share the whole dataset available. I share the 100 samples interval plotted in the paper figures
- restored segmentation maps: the segmentation maps from SL- and CL- PickNets for the 100 samples interval (see above)
- FitNet05 on segmentation maps:
    - FitNet05 x SL-PickNet: features correlation results on SL segmentation map
    - FitNet05 x CL-PickNet: features correlation results on CL segmentation map
    These data have shape (101, 4, 16), where:
        - 101 is the number of windows in which we perform features correlation in the 100 samples interval
        - 4 is the number of elements returned from FitNet05 in each window:
            - 0: predicted curve#1
            - 1: standard deviation for each points on curve#1
            - 2: predicted curve#2
            - 3: standard deviation for each points on curve#2
        - 16 is the number of points in each curve
