  <h1>Attilio's Portfolio</h1>
  <h2>Attilio Molossi is a Ph.D. student in the Earth Science, Fluid-dynamics and Mathematics program of the University of Trieste (Italy). The program aims at the interdisciplinary training of students in the fields of Earth system science, mathematics, modeling and applications. His project focuses on the implementation of interdisciplinary methods, based on geophysics and AI, to optimize the characterization, exploration and exploitation of natural resources. In his first year and a half of research, he focused on the study of algorithmic and heuristic approaches for the semi-automation of the tedious LWD image logs interpretation task, to propose efficient methods and workflows to reduce drilling risks and support operational decision-making.
